#### Breakdown of work done
Norman
* Original owner of source code, including ovearching architecture of the gui/panel/animation panels
* Working building model used to branching into individual tasks
* Along with Aleena modified source code for city semantics, two windows, and foundation for everyone to branch off and work on their own buildings and individual contributions
* Researched how to import images to the program, how to run image/state based animations, how to properly load them, how to run a sequence given source of sprite files, move them a certain rate, switch them based on states (eg direction). This system is used everywhere in the city.
* Delta Gui movement system that is implemented in every building and in city layout, a comperehensive movement system for everyone to navigate their gui
* Worked extensively on PersonAgent methodology, especially early, looking at the designs given in class to create the role/person interactions, Role class, interfaces (even for other buildings, created the main interfaces so roles are able to be passed around the city), integrating them and creating a system for people to use and modify for specific tasks (eg, transportation, work systems, timer systems, etc).
* Organized CityGui Layouts, CityLists layouts/Java interfaces, the City Animation Panel, implemented Person Gui
* Personal functioning restaurant with polished spriting and animations, and integrated in to city
* City animated environment (Transparent clouds that move about the city independently)
* Integrating everyone's individual contribution into the city involving personAgent and roles (Which involves fixing and adding functionality to interfaces for each of the agents that enter a building, creating role classes for every agent that is passed into the city, particularly the "customers", copying and deleting individual code so that roles run with the right interfaces, created Restaurant, Apartment, Bank classes with their respective panels for people to keep working on their implementations and send their people into their buildings, a person/money retainment system to keep track of money/inventories as well as returning to the city)
* Gui listener system using JObjects (With Aleena) that trigger functions that trigger events, messages, and actions.
* Lots of photoshop and parsing work for sprites, background images, specialized tile sets, for transportation, restaurant animations.
* How to click the buildings so that windows are displayed with what is inside in the city view rather than creating a new building each time, and a way for GUI not to pause itself when moving out of the window.
* Found spriting layout/themes/sprites for the city.
* Clicking people in the city opens up a new window with information about the person, closing this frame won't quit the program. Also closing any frame that is not the city won't quit the program.
* Hand-merging branches
* Figuring out a system for people to go in and out of work, setting buildings to open or closed based on whether there are enough workers and the proper roles are created, and let people in and out based on that. Workers in the restaurant are able to go in at properly. Buildings also now don't limit gui movements because they are replaced by the city rather than minimized. Added Guis for every role in the restaurant, because some did not need gui before and now they do because sometimes the restaurant has no cashier. Added images and animation also for those (host, cashier).
* People can now leave work given specific conditions for restaurant (eg cashier not having customers, and tables being empty) for work shifts
* Unit testing producer/consumer model in restaurant
* Unit tested people properly added into the city
* Unit tested basic roles added to person
* A lot of my role involved me creating new content for people to use as a basis to branch off and add functionality.

Chris
  + Restaurant Design Doc
  + Housing: v1 has an apartment complex but no houses
  + Many people stay in the same complex in different rooms/beds with a common kitchen area
  + Issue tracker: created a new window that took each console output and created an alert and displayed it appropriately.  This involved working with each file and tailoring it to this new system.
  + Developed some restaurant-market interactions before we knew it wasn't going to be required of us.  This will be utilized in v2.
  + Unit testing for LandlordAgent in housing

Daniel 
  + PersonAgent Design Doc
  + Buses
  ++ Must be able to pick people up and take them to destinations
  + BusStops
  + + hold people as they wait for the bus to pick them up
  + TransportationCompany
  + + Handles all decision making for bus as in when it is at a stop pick people up and drop others off
  + + This will eventually also handle any collision interactions
  + PersonAgent decision in walking to locations based on start position and end position
  + + People should walk when they don't have a car or want to take bus, they should take a bus only when they want to but have no car and walking is done as a default. A random function will decide if a person is always going to take a bus or walk unless they have a car,
  + Payment system so that everyone gets paid at a certain time and only if working at that time. Payment will later on be based upon job role and pay according to how much they've worked.
  + Unit Testing BusStopAgent
  + Unit Testing BusAgent
  + the two unit tests are the main components used in transportation.

Aleena
  + PersonAgent AI design & implementation
  + Timers for eating, going to sleep, going to work, leaving work
  + Housing design document
  + Market design document
  + Bank design document
  + Bank implementation
  + Market implementation
  + City GUI controls
  + Time management singleton
  + Clock class
  + Sprites, animation for bank, market
  + Integrating bank
  + Integrating market 
  + Inventory management
  + Shared data monitor in restaurant
  + In-building GUI clean-up
  + Bank unit testing
  + Solved team git issues


#### How to run system
![](http://i.imgur.com/bKOvnio.png)
  + Build from ant file, compile, run 'CityGui', and choose an option below
  + Double-click on the building to open the window
  + Exit the building window to go back to city
  + GUI controls for Bank, Market, Housing, Restaurant on left side only affect 'non AI' agents
  + Bus system is off by default (because some computers have some issues with it), you can turn it on by selecting 'Bus' under City Controls

### Notes
#### We've discussed with Professor Wilczynski about an issue with teammate work, so please take that into consideration for grading. We please ask you to contact him for the details. We are a four-person team creating a 6-person project with great emphasis on aesthetics and animation. We are down two people, one who dropped the course and one who submitted zero lines of code to the project and has not showing up to meetings. 

For V1, we were instructed to "include a simple market from one of your Restaurant deliveries, no animation" because of the missing team member, but we were able to add a fully functioning market to our city, but we unfortunately ran out of time for full integration. 

For V2, the professor told us to use our discretion in deciding what parts of the project we can and can't do with our smaller group. 

Our drop-out team member was assigned to work on:
+ Market (which we fully implemented, but not fully integrated)
+ Transportation (with Daniel, who would take over the entire segment)
+ Person role and AI design (which the rest of our group and to take over)

Because we had to spend time working on these missing core features, we missed some of the details outlined on the rubric.

Additionally, one of our team members, Chris, was sick and then hospitalized during key integration period.

###Normative Scenarios â€“ Baseline, i.e., little or no interleaving
####A. Scenario: [Tests all the behaviors.]
1.  Press button 'A'
2.  North bank, Norman's restaurant, and both markets will be employed, one non-worker will go about his day.
####B. Scenario: [Tests all the behaviors.]
1.  Press button 'B'
2.  North bank, Norman's restaurant, X's restaurant, and both markets will be employed, three non-workers will go about their day.
####C. Scenario: [Tests cook, cashier, market interaction.]
  N/A: Team member responsible dropped course
####D. Scenario: For large teams [Tests party behavior.]
  N/A: Small team
####E. Scenario: [Shows bus-stop behavior]
1.  Do XYZ
###Non-Normative Scenarios â€“ Baseline, i.e., minimum interleaving
####F. Scenario: [Shows that people know they can't visit certain workplaces.]
1.  Press button 'F'. North bank, Norman's restaurant, and both markets will be employed.
For each building B:
1. Create a 'No AI' person, click 'Go' under category B. This person will go to B and interact.
2. Click 'Close B' button, workers will leave
3. Create another 'No AI' person, click 'Go' under category B. This person will not go to B because it is closed.
This scenario works for: banks, markets, and restaurants.
  
####G. Scenario: [Tests market behavior]
  N/A: Team member responsible dropped course
####H. Scenario: For large teams [Tests party behavior.]
  N/A: Small team
####I. Scenario: For large teams [Tests party behavior.]
  N/A: Small team
###Normative Scenarios â€“ Normal operation, i.e., normal interleaving
####J. Scenario:
Citizens:
1.  Bank: 3 tellers, 1 host (x2)
2.  Restaurants: 1 host, 1 cashier, 1 cook, 3 waiters (x4)
3.  Markets: 3 tellers, 1 host (x2)
4.  Housing: 1 landlord, 3 repairman (x1)
5.  No Job: 6+
Total: 50+

2.  People eat at home based upon their wealth class and inventory. People decide which building to visit based on distance.
###Non-Normative Scenarios â€“ 3 points a scenario; you design them
####O. Scenario: Bank Robbery
1.  Press button 'O', creates workers for 1 bank, and 1 robber
2.  After employees go to bank, robber will enter.
3.  Each worker has a 20% chance of having a gun on them, if they do the robbery will fail. Otherwise the robbery will succeed.
4.  The robber will try to rob a bank once a day, otherwise he will go about his day like a normal person (though he does not try to go to the bank to do 'normal' activities so that he is not recognized).
5.  Since the town has no police, robberies are a usual occurrence and so the tellers, hosts, and other customers are unfazed by a nearby robbery.
####P. Scenario: Vehicle accident





####Q. Scenario: Vehicle hits pedestrian





####R. Scenario: Weekend behavior is different
1.  Press button 'R', which fully employees the city and move the clock time to Saturday at the normal work shift.
2.  The banks are closed on weekends (and so bank workers go about their day-to-day business) and two restaurants are closed (Aleena's, Chris'). 
####S. Scenario: Job Changing/Firing/Shifts
  N/A: Team member responsible dropped course
###Rubric for Individual Grades
Here EACH of your components is subject to the following:
####T. Proper implementation of producer-consumer code
1.  Aleena did the producer-consumer code for Restaurant
2.  Norman for RestaurantA
3.  Chris for RestaurantC
4.  Daniel for RestaurantD


#### What doesn't work
  + We have a living system for apartments. We did not have time to add in housing (See notes)
  + Landlords do not automatically collect rent. The housing system for this interaction was built correctly (by Chris), but it was not integrated in time for v2 (by team).
  + Market is fully implemented, but employees are robots right now, working 24/7 (See notes above)
